# Mini Project 1: Basic Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes student performance based on marks data using fundamental Python programming concepts.

## Features
- Calculates total, average, and grade
- Classifies students as Pass/Fail
- Identifies highest and lowest marks
- Handles invalid entries gracefully

## Technologies Used
- Python 3 (via Google Colab)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- CSV files for dataset

## Dataset
The dataset `students.csv` contains:
- Student_ID
- Name
- Subject
- Marks

## Execution Steps
1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset and notebook
3. Run cells sequentially
4. View the output and export final CSV

## Results
Final results are saved in `student_performance_results.csv`.
